<h1> Private Chef Escoffier</h1>

<h3> First Milesotne. User Centic Frontend Development. Code Institute.</h3>
 This is a website that promote an imaginary chef organising private event.<br>
The website include a description of the chef study and work experience,<br>
example of dishes with photos, imaginary quotes and a contact form.

<h3> Demo </h3>
A live demo can be found at GitHub.  https://mrsebastino.github.io/First-Milestone/

<h3>UX/UI</h3>
My intent with this website is to make it simple to use, attractive and showcase<br>
the experience of the private chef. I used a handwriting font to give it a more personal and artistic touch.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>html  </li>
<li>css </li>
<li>Bootstrap v 4.3.1</li>
</ul>

<h3> Features</h3>
 The Navbar at the top is taken from Bootstrap, i have made adjustemnt. The animation on the tiltle is from animate.css.
 In the footer i've added a link to the top of the page and social media link. I removed the top of the page link in the footer for the  
 mobile and moved the social icon to the center.
 In the contact section, i used a  contact form and a button submit form from Bootstraps, i have customised both the form and the button.

I had an horizontal overflow,
Bug encountered. At the moment when i click on the logo in the nav bar and in the footer it goes from orange to white which is expected but just before it
refresh the page it goes blue for a few second. None of the other hover animation for events, quotes and contact have that problem. The bugs were fixed
by asking on Slack, Googling and using devtools.

<h3>Testing</h3>

I have tested the pages on my mobile and on friends mobile, the site is responsive on Samsung devices and Huawei. I also check with the devtools in Google Chrome
<ol>
I have filled the contact form but not the email, and has expected i was promted to fill the the box.
I have tried the above with all the fields that need filled and every time i had the expexted result of being promted to fill the box.
I have set up the submit to a non existing website and the response is "mike.escoffier sent an invalid response" which is the expected outcome.
I am confident that the website has been tested and is responsive on mobile and desktop.
</ol>
<h3>Deployment</h3>

The sites is deployed using GitHUb, it is deployed directly using the master branch.
That allowed me to make change to the webpages and it will update automatically.
