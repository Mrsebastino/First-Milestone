<h1> Private Chef Escoffier</h1>

<h3> First Milesotne. User Centic Frontend Development. Code Institute.</h3>
 This is a website that promote an imaginary chef organising private event.<br>
The website include a description of the chef study and work experience,<br>
example of dishes with photos, imaginary quotes and a contact form.

<h3> Demo </h3>
A live demo can be found at GitHub.  https://mrsebastino.github.io/First-Milestone/

<h3>UX/UI</h3>
My intent with this website is to make it simple to use, attractive and showcase<br>
the experience of the private chef.

<h3> Features</h3>
 The Navbar at the top allow the user to navigate from one page to another.
 In the footer i've added a link to the landing page and social media link. I removed the link to the landing page for mobile and moved the socialicon to the center.
 In the contact page, i used a form from bootstraps and also the submit button form, i have customised both the form and the button.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>html 5 </li>
<li>css 3</li>
<li>Bootstrap v 4.3.1</li>
<li>Chrome Devtools</li>
</ul>

Bug encountered. At the moment when i click on the logo in the nav bar and in the footer it goes from white to orange which is expected but just before it
refresh the page it goes blue for a few second. None of the other hover animation for events, quotes and contact have that problem.

<h3>Testing</h3>

I have tested the pages on my mobile and on friends mobile, the site is responsive and i have not encounteredany problem.
<ol>
I have filled the form but not the email, and has expected i was promted to fill the the box.
I have tried the above with all the fields that need filled and every time i had the expexted result of being promtedto fill the box.
I have set up the submit to a non existing website and the response is "mike.escoffier sent an invalid response" which is the expected outcome.
I am confident that the website has been tested and is responsive on mobile and desktop.
</ol>
<h3>Deployment</h3>

I have use GITHUB to deploy the website.
