<h1> Private Chef Escoffier</h1>

<h3> First Milesotne. User Centic Frontend Development. Code Institute.</h3>
 This is a website that promote an imaginary chef organising private event.<br>
The website include a description of the chef study and work experience,<br>
example of dishes with photos, imaginary quotes and a contact form.

<h3> Demo </h3>
A live demo can be found at GitHub. 

<h3>UX</h3>
My intent with this website is to make it simple to use, attractive and showcase<br>
the experience and the reliability of the private chef.

<h3> Features</h3>
 The Navbar at the top allow the user to navigate from one page to another.
 In the footer i've added a link to the top of the page and social media link.
 in the contact page, i used a form from bootstraps

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>html 5 </li>
<li>css 3</li>
<li>Bootstrap v 4.3.1</li>
<li>Chrome Devtools</li>
</ul>

Bug encountered. At the moment when i click on the logo in the nav bar and in the footer it goes from white to orange which is expected but just before it
refresh the page it goes blue for a few second. None of the other hover animation for events, quotes and contact have that problem.
